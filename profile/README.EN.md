# RAE API Org

Welcome to the **RAE API Organization**. Here you’ll find a collection of tools and resources created for those who want to interact with the Spanish language programmatically. The motivation is simple: the Real Academia Española (RAE) hasn’t shown much interest in providing a public, developer-friendly API for its dictionary. So, in the absence of official solutions, we decided to build our own.

This is a non-profit project. Our goal is purely educational and collaborative—we don’t intend to claim ownership over RAE’s content (which, for the record, is kept private despite being about a language we all speak). By using this API and its tools, you’re responsible for how you use its resources.

## 🌟 Mission

We aim to make modern Spanish language data—definitions, conjugations, and more—easy to access for developers. Whether you’re building word games, educational apps, or linguistic research tools, you’ll hopefully find a useful, straightforward base here, albeit unofficial.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **[rae-api.com](https://rae-api.com)**
An unofficial API for querying the RAE dictionary. It offers:
- Word definitions.
- Verb conjugations.
- Reverse search (find words by their definition).
- Word of the day.
- Support for polysemous words and idiomatic expressions.

### 2. **[go-rae](https://github.com/rae-api-com/go-rae)**
A Go client for easy integration with the RAE API.

### 3. **[rae-tui](https://github.com/rae-api-com/rae-tui)**
A terminal-based user interface to explore the RAE dictionary interactively.

### 4. **[rae-raycast](https://github.com/rae-api-com/rae-raycast)**
A Raycast extension to query words, verbs, conjugations, the word of the day, and even get random words—directly from your desktop.

## 🛠️ Features in Progress

- **Fuzzy Search:** More useful results even with inexact matches or derived words.
- **Inverse Indexing:** Search for words by their definitions.
- **Improved Parsing:** Adapting to the RAE’s ever-changing HTML structure.
- **Authentication and Limits:** To ensure fair use and prevent abuse.
- **Apify Integration:** More advanced workflows using [Apify](https://apify.com/sonirico/diccionario-de-la-real-academia-de-la-lengua-espanola-rae-ppr).

## 💡 Inspiration

The lack of an official API—or even a public database—from the RAE has left many of us searching for workarounds: scraping, collaboration, and a bit of patience. This project exists, modestly, to fill that gap and make dictionary queries easier for those who need them.

## 🤝 Community

We appreciate all contributions and suggestions. If this project helps your own tools (word games, educational apps, research, Anki integrations...), let us know and help us improve.

## 💬 FAQ

### Is this official?
No. We have no official ties to the RAE. This project simply provides tools the institution currently does not.

### Can I use this for my own project?
Absolutely—feel free! It’s open to all, though donations to help keep the servers running are always welcome: [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/sonirico).

### What happens if the RAE changes their website?
The API relies on scraping. If their HTML changes, certain features might be temporarily interrupted. We do store data locally to help ensure some continuity when that happens.
