# RAE API Org

Welcome to the **RAE API Organization**! This GitHub organization is dedicated to providing tools and resources for developers and enthusiasts who want to interact with the Spanish language in creative and programmatic ways. Our flagship project, **rae-api.com**, is an unofficial API for querying the Real Academia Espa√±ola (RAE) dictionary and related linguistic data.


## üåü Mission

The goal of this organization is to make the Spanish language more accessible to developers by providing APIs, libraries, and tools that simplify working with words, definitions, and conjugations. Whether you're building a game like Wordle/PalabReto, creating educational tools, or conducting linguistic research, our resources are here to help.


## üöÄ Projects

### 1. **[rae-api.com](https://rae-api.com)**
An unofficial API for querying the RAE dictionary. It provides:
- Definitions of words.
- Conjugations for verbs.
- Reverse search (find words based on their definitions).
- Word of the day.
- Support for polysemic words and locutions.

### 2. **[go-rae](https://github.com/rae-api-com/go-rae)**
A Go client library for interacting with the RAE API. It simplifies integration with the API for Go developers.

### 3. **[rae-tui](https://github.com/rae-api-com/rae-tui)**
A terminal-based user interface (TUI) for exploring the RAE dictionary interactively. Built with `tview` and designed for a seamless user experience.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features in Progress

- **Fuzzy Search**: Improve search results for partial matches or derived words.
- **Inverse Indexing**: Enable reverse lookups for words based on their definitions.
- **Improved Parsing**: Handle the chaotic and ever-changing HTML structure of the RAE website.
- **Authentication**: Introduce API keys to manage usage and prevent abuse.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure fair usage for all users.
- **Apify Integration**: Create complex workflows using [https://apify.com/sonirico/diccionario-de-la-real-academia-de-la-lengua-espanola-rae-ppr](apify integration).

## üí° Inspiration

This project was born out of the need for a reliable resource to query Spanish words programmatically. Many developers, including myself, have struggled to find an official API or database for the RAE dictionary. After exploring alternatives like web scraping and reverse-engineering, I decided to create **rae-api.com** to fill this gap.


## ü§ù Community

We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration! If you're using our tools for your projects, let us know. Some examples of how the API has been used:
- Word-based games like Wordle/PalabReto.
- Educational tools for learning Spanish.
- Integration with flashcard apps like Anki.


## üí¨ FAQ

### Is this an official API from the RAE?
No, this is an unofficial API created to make the RAE's linguistic data more accessible. The HTML structure of the RAE website is complex and changes frequently, so this project aims to simplify access for developers.

### Can I use this API for my project?
Yes! The API is free to use, but donations are welcome to help maintain the server. If you're using it heavily, consider supporting the project via [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/sonirico).

### What happens if the RAE changes its website?
The API relies on scraping the RAE's website, so changes to their HTML structure can temporarily break the service. However, we store parsed data locally to ensure continuity even if scraping becomes temporarily unavailable.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support the Project
